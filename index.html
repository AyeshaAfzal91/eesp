                    <h2>Workshop Objective</h2>
                    <p>The EESP workshop fosters the exchange of innovative strategies, tools, and best practices to enhance energy efficiency in modern computing environments. With rising energy costs, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and mounting pressure on power infrastructure, optimizing energy use has become a crucial priority for sustainable computing infrastructure.
EESP workshop explores how to optimize computing environments by effectively balancing performance, power consumption, and sustainability trade-offs. It will provide participants a comprehensive guidebook featuring strategies tailored for exascale, Tier-1 and Tier-2 supercomputing centers. By learning about how to adopt greener, cost-effective, and energy-efficient practices, attendees will gain a competitive edge in driving sustainability across their systems.
Aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, the workshop encourages collaboration between HPC and AI communities to promote environmentally responsible innovation. It will provide guidance for system operators and facility managers on reducing Power Usage Effectiveness and sourcing green energy, while supporting users in making energy-conscious decisions through thoughtful experiment design. 
In addition, EESP emphasizes cross-layer innovation -- integrating advances in hardware, software, and runtime systems with data-driven analytics and monitoring -- to achieve end-to-end visibility and adaptability in energy use. 
The workshop also emphasizes full-lifecycle sustainability -- from system design and operations to reuse and decommissioning -- and considers how HPC strategies can support energy-efficient AI infrastructure amid growing convergence.
While current tenders often emphasize raw hardware metrics, this workshop highlights the importance of sustained (application) performance, rather than peak performance, as a critical metric for long-term success.</p>

                <section id="scope">
                    <h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>EESP invites academia, supercomputing centers, industry, national laboratories, and policymakers to collaborate on advancing energy-efficient practices. Topics include software development, hardware design, energy-efficient methods, operational case studies, benchmarking frameworks, AI–HPC convergence, and sustainability metrics beyond energy efficiency such as carbon emissions. The workshop fosters dialogue between Tier-0/1 and Tier-2 centers to help adapt Tier-0/1 innovations for more constrained budgets. It targets financial and technical solutions applicable to HPC clusters, data centers, and cloud infrastructures worldwide.</p>                </section>
