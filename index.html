                    <h2>Workshop Objective</h2>
                    <p>The EESP workshop fosters the exchange of innovative strategies, tools, and best practices to enhance energy efficiency in computing environments. Amid rising energy costs and ambitious sustainability goals, optimizing energy use is critical for managing computing infrastructure. The workshop focuses on balancing performance, power consumption, and sustainability, offering practical guidance for exascale, Tier-1, and Tier-2 centers. Attendees will gain insights into greener, cost-effective practices to drive sustainability. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals, EESP bridges HPC and AI communities, empowering operators to reduce Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), source green energy, and help users make energy-conscious decisions. It highlights sustained performance over peak performance for future competitiveness.</p>

                    <h2>Workshop Scope</h2>
                    <p>EESP invites academia, supercomputing centers, industry, and policymakers to collaborate on advancing energy-efficient practices. Topics include software development, hardware design, and energy-efficient practices across various computing environments such as HPC clusters, data centers, and cloud infrastructure. Energy efficiency is a growing challenge, particularly for Tier-2 centers with limited resources. This workshop fosters dialogue between Tier-0/1 and Tier-2 centers to adapt Tier-0/1 innovations for constrained budgets. It targets financial and technical solutions applicable to HPC clusters, data centers, and cloud infrastructures globally.</p>
